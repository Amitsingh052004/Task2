# Task2

We used Power BI Desktop to create interactive visualizations from a cleaned sales dataset. By importing the CSV file, we built visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to analyze total sales, top customers, product performance, and monthly trends. Slicers and KPIs were added to make the dashboard more dynamic and insightful.
